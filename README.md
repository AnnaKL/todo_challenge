## Todo Challenge

To do list application built with:
* Javascript.
* Angular JS (open source front-end MVC framework).

Tested with:
* Karma (Spectacular Test Runner for Javascript).
* Protractor (end-to-end test framework for AngularJS applications).

Implemented user stories:

```
As a forgetful person
I want to store my tasks
So that I don't forget them

As a person with limited time
I want to instantly be able to update my todo list (adding and changing entries)
So that I have more time to think about other things

As a person who actually gets stuff done
I want to mark my tasks as done
So that I don't do them twice

As a person with a lot of tasks
I want to be able to filter my tasks by "All", "Active", "Complete"
So that I only see the relevant tasks

As a person who doesn't like counting by hand
I want to see a total number of tasks
So that I don't have to count

As someone who has done lots of stuff
I want to be able to clear my completed tasks
So I never see them again
```


## Additional steps

* Deploy app to Heroku.
* Create a persistance layer (e.g. MongoDB), or use LocalStorage or the filesystem through Node.
* Styling with CSS (Bootstrap or Foundation framework).
